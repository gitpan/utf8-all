NAME
    utf8::all - turn on Unicode - all of it

VERSION
    version 0.012

SYNOPSIS
        use utf8::all; # Turn on UTF-8. All of it.

        open my $in, '<', 'contains-utf8';  # UTF-8 already turned on here
        print length 'føø bār';             # 7 UTF-8 characters
        my $utf8_arg = shift @ARGV;         # @ARGV is UTF-8 too!

DESCRIPTION
    utf8 allows you to write your Perl encoded in UTF-8. That means UTF-8
    strings, variable names, and regular expressions. "utf8::all" goes
    further, and makes @ARGV encoded in UTF-8, and filehandles are opened
    with UTF-8 encoding turned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT,
    STDERR), and charnames are imported so "\N{...}" sequences can be used
    to compile Unicode characters based on names. If you *don't* want UTF-8
    for a particular filehandle, you'll have to set "binmode $filehandle".

    The pragma is lexically-scoped, so you can do the following if you had
    some reason to:

        {
            use utf8::all;
            open my $out, '>', 'outfile';
            my $utf8_str = 'føø bār';
            print length $utf8_str, "\n"; # 7
            print $out $utf8_str;         # out as utf8
        }
        open my $in, '<', 'outfile';      # in as raw
        my $text = do { local $/; <$in>};
        print length $text, "\n";         # 10, not 7!

INTERACTION WITH AUTODIE
    If you use autodie, which is a great idea, you need to use at least
    version 2.12, released on June 26, 2012
    <https://metacpan.org/source/PJF/autodie-2.12/Changes#L3>. Otherwise,
    autodie obliterates the IO layers set by the open pragma. See RT #54777
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54777> and GH #7
    <https://github.com/doherty/utf8-all/issues/7>.
