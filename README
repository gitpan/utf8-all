NAME
    utf8::all - turn on unicode. All of it.

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
        use utf8::all; # Turn on UTF-8. All of it.

        open my $in, '<', 'contains-utf8';  # UTF-8 already turned on here
        print length 'føø bār';             # 7 UTF-8 characters
        my $utf8_arg = shift @ARGV;         # @ARGV is UTF-8 too!

DESCRIPTION
    utf8 allows you to write your Perl encoded in UTF-8. That means UTF-8
    strings, variable names, and regular expressions. "utf8::all" goes
    further, and makes @ARGV encoded in UTF-8, and filehandles are opened
    with UTF-8 encoding turned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT,
    STDERR). If you *don't* want UTF-8 for a particular filehandle, you'll
    have to set "binmode $filehandle".

    The pragma is lexically-scoped, so you can do the following if you had
    some reason to:

        {
            use utf8::all;
            open my $out, '>', 'outfile';
            my $utf8_str = 'føø bār';
            print length $utf8_str, "\n"; # 7
            print $out $utf8_str;         # out as utf8
        }
        open my $in, '<', 'outfile';      # in as raw
        my $text = do { local $/; <$in>};
        print length $text, "\n";         # 10, not 7!
